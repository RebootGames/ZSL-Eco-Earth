<h3>Game Overview</h3>
<br />
  
I. Introduction

In this 2D web application game, the players will walk through the greenhouse gas footprint chain for four products; mobile phones, beef, leaving electronic devices on standby and plastic bottles. Along the chain journey players will take ownership of releasing the gases into the atmosphere, and as a result will see and hear about the effect on the four related habitats; the arctic tundra, rainforest, ocean and British countryside. A habitat animal narrator will guide players through the journey providing educational facts for enhanced learning. Players will have the opportunity to participate in mini games during the chain journey to select the animals who reside in the habitats they’re learning about, and to provide a pledge on how they promise to try and help.

II. Objective of the Game

The objective of the game is for each player to learn about, and take ownership of, the greenhouse gas footprint chain for each of the four products, as well as providing a pledge of what they’ll do to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

<h3>Story</h3>
<br />

I. Outline

Production and disposal of mobile phones, beef, leaving electronic devices on standby and plastic bottles are having a detrimental impact on four habitats around the world. An understanding of this process, and a pledge to help, is absolutely vital to the future of these habitats and the animals that live there.

II. Story Synopsis

The story relates the greenhouse gas footprint chain of production to disposal of four products to four habitats from around the world. At each stage of the chain, players are presented with a fact and relevant image, and the responsibility to release the emitted gases into the atmosphere. Upon release, the habitat view becomes darker and bleaker as the on-screen greenhouse gas meter rises. An animal narrator for each habitat describes the impact the gases are having on the habitat and once the chain journey is completed, they return to ask for help saving their home giving the players the option to provide select a predefined pledge to help, or not. Players who pledge will witness the on-screen pledge meter rising, which will impact their overall score at the end of the game.

I. Camera

The camera will be stationary, with a top-down view of the world map or a zoom of each habitat during all scenes.

II. Team Play

This game will be played in teams. 

III. General Movement

Players will be required to tap and slide during game play. 

Tap: Required for habitat selection within the World View, to answer questions, participate in game play and select each stage of the chains on each habitat window.

Slide: Required to ‘release the gases’ into the atmosphere within the habitat chain facts.

VI. Initial Set Up

The web app opens with a request for the team to create a team name and select an animal character of their choice. A ‘start’ button will move them into the World View, where the world is displayed with four unlocked habitats to select.

VII. Points

All teams will begin with 10,000 points, the maximum points. Each team must answer questions correctly to maintain their score, as each incorrect answer will reduce the score by 500 points.
